###NFT(Non-Fungible Token)

*NFTs turn your digital assets into one of a kind by creating a unique digital signature which defines the ownership of your assets and that can be bought and sold for real money like cryptocurrency or any other asset like a Non-Fungible Token

*Non-Fungible Tokens means that they are not interchangeable and each of them represents unique assets owned by a specific person

*Each NFT contains distinguishable information like who owns the digital asset and who sold it making it distinct and easily verifiable as it is impossible to forge such a certificate it will be more secure

*NFT basically creates a blockchain-based digital certificate for the digital collectibles including games , music , art and many more.This certificate gives your artwork a unique identity

*one of the greatest advantages of the NFT technology is that it allows artists and content creators to retain their full copyright

###IPFS(InterPlametary File Storage)

*IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

*IPFS moves from "location based" addressing to "content based" addressing

*Every file has a unique hash which can be used to search for the specific file.Since the file is addressed using hash it can be verified whether the received file is the requested file by comparing the hash.

*Another nice feature of using hashes to address content is deduplication.When multiple people publish the same file on IPFS , it will only be created once and that makes the network very efficient

*Files are stored inside IPFS objects and these objects can store upto 256kb worth of data and can contain links to other IPFS objects.For files larger than 256 kb like an image or video,they are split up into multi[le IPFS objects that are all 256kb in size and afterwards the system will create an empty IPFS object that links to all other pieces of the file

*Because IPFS uses content based addressing once something is added,it cannot be changed anymore.It's an immutable datastore much like a blockchain.IPFS supports versioning of files to change stuff on it

*Mainnet is a completely developed blockchain platform for users to send and receive cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of digital data that is recorded on a distributed ledger).

*A mainnet is an independent blockchain running its own network with its own technology and protocol

*Costs real money not only to buy bitcoins but also as transaction fees

***

*Testnet is used by programmers and developers to test and troubleshoot all the aspects and features of a blockchain network before they are sure the system is secure and ready for the mainnet launch.

*In other words, a testnet only exists as a working prototype for a blockchain project

*Test network runs in parallel with mainnet,except that the value of these coins are negligible and it is essentially free to acquire testnet bitcoins.
