###NFT(Non-Fungible Token)

-NFTs turn your digital assets into one of a kind by creating a unique digital signature which defines the ownership of your assets and that can be bought and sold for real money like cryptocurrency or any other asset like a Non-Fungible Token

-Non-Fungible Tokens means that they are not interchangeable and each of them represents unique assets owned by a specific person

-Each NFT contains distinguishable information like who owns the digital asset and who sold it making it distinct and easily verifiable as it is impossible to forge such a certificate it will be more secure

-NFT basically creates a blockchain-based digital certificate for the digital collectibles including games , music , art and many more.This certificate gives your artwork a unique identity
